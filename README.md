## How to use Github

### Instalation

first you need to install git

on linux simply use
```console
apt-get install git-all
```
for mac or windows you can ether use a [desktop version](https://desktop.github.com/) (wich I never tried) or a [bash version](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (less user friendly but more control)
for the bash version on mac you can check if it is allready installed by using 
```console
git --version
```
### Using git (Bash)

The first thing you will do is clone the repository. To do so simply type 
```console
git clone https://github.com/LouiseDelz/Simulation-of-bank-run.git
```
Then it will create a *Simulation-of-bank-run* folder. You can then go inside with  
```console
cd Simulation-of-bank-run
```
After doing your work eather modifying, creating files, you can add your modification like so
```console
git add .
```
```console
git commit -m "write what you've done"
```
Finally to publish it on github use the command  
```console
git push origin
```
*/!\ Before starting working allways use the command *
```console
git pull 
```
it will keep your folder up to date in case someone have modified somes files
